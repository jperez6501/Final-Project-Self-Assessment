# Final-Project-Self-Assessment

## Self Assessment 
The main role that I played during the group project was taking the lead square role. I was in charge of updating the github, doing pull requests and merging requests so that our team’s github was as clean as possible. Another big part that I played was creating and updating the README. 
README A big part of the README was gathering all our data sources and including the links as well as a description about the purpose that each of those data sources played in our project. Next, I went through the sections of my team mates section and interpret their work and include screenshots of those graphics into the read me. 
Another key role that I played was providing a helping hand in other aspects of the project, that included updating google slides. Making sure that the github included the how while our slides focused mainly on the why. As a project, our biggest hurdle was machine learning, we met as a team a lot to bounce ideas off each other and try and see if we could find a solution as a team. 
## Team Assessment 
Our biggest challenge in communication was trying to find a time to meet. During the course, you are able to do your assignments and work on your own schedule. This is not possible during a group project and we constantly had to figure out a time that works for all 5 of us. Next time, it might be more helpful to have reoccurring meetings set up at the beginning that way people can try to work around our meetings and know ahead of time when we are meeting. 
As a team, our biggest strength was everyone wanting to provide a helping hand. It was nice to see teammates constantly jump in to assist one another when one of us was struggling with a part of the project. This is very crucial because we are working as a team. 
## Summary of the Project 
•	The topic of our project was trying to use a plethora of technologies in order to prove that there is a correlation between a rise of covid cases and a rise in any mental illnesses (AMI). 

•	We first started with the machine learning model the training score was 0.58 and the testing score was 0.89. Next we ran the Gradient Boosting Regressor with an accuracy score at 0.94.
